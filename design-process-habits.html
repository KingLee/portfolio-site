					<h2>How Painting Changed My Thinking</h2>
					<p> 
						Have you ever taken a painting class? You should.
					</p>
					<p> 
						Painting technique, process, and critique continues to be one of the most important things I gained from my college experience that has no direct relevance to my UX and UI work. You learn a lot when you’re fumbling through new ways of creating art. Teachers constantly hammer things into your brain that only make sense years later… and now I’m here to share one of those lessons.
					</p>
					<p> 
						One of the greatest takeaways from my painting experience is this:
					</p>
					<p> 
						<i>“Changing things in your process or technique, will yield new perspectives that inform your end result.”</i>
					</p>
					<p> 
						What does this mean? It means that if you change your process, macro or micro, you come to different end results. It seems pretty obvious, but this is especially powerful when you consider how many pitfalls are contained within the creation of a web product and how we may be able to use different techniques to avoid or at least ease the pain of these problems. Designers usually face micro-process problems dealing with creating layouts, designs, UX solutions, type solutions, etc… and occasionally knock into some macro-process problems, such as project budgets.
					</p>
					<p> 
						Here are a few problems designers might encounter in day-to-day work:
					</p>
					<ul class="post-li">
						<li>Type choices and lockups are too similar across projects.</li>
						<li>Layout conventions are getting reused.</li>
						<li>Color combinations are becoming repetitive.</li>
						<li>Feedback out of critiques from peers or clients is ambiguous.</li>
					</ul>
					<p> 
						The list goes on…
					</p>
					<p> 
						I could speak to the macro problems, but that could be another post altogether. Let’s just focus on the micro-process problems that designers run into on a constant basis.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="text-container bottom-margin-double">
					<h2>Design Ruts</h2>
					
					<p> 
						Do all your layouts look similar? Are your type choices and lockups getting stagnant? What about your colors? It’s ok, we’ve all been there… a few of us have been there more than once. But what can you do about it? The answer for me is to start exploring the unknown, and hopefully this post can help direct you to a starting point:
					</p>
					<h3 style="margin:1em auto .5em auto">Sketching</h3>
					<h4>Switch Up Your Scale</h4>
					<p>
						Do you work in an 8.5x11” notebook to sketch? Go bigger! Consider using a large canvas, whether it is a whiteboard on a wall or giant sheets of paper on the ground. Just by the way I've interacted with drawing on a wall, I've happened upon solutions that a pen and paper couldn't give me.
					</p> 
					<h4>Change Your Medium</h4>
					<p>
						Have you ever tried to sketch out wireframe ideas on an iPhone? What inherent limitations of sketching on the iPhone will contribute to your final design? There is a lack of control that can cause happy accidents all over the place. The size restriction gets you to think about the most essential components and the simplest way to create them with your finger. This could help you forget about the details and focus on some of the main concepts or functionality of your project.
					</p>
					<h4>Double, Triple Your Sketches</h4>
					<p>
						How many solutions do you come up with for the problem you are trying to solve? 3? 5? 10? If you want to find a creative solution to the problem, you have to double, or triple the amount of solutions you normally come up with. They don’t have to be perfect! The only rule is that you can’t repeat solutions. It gets rid of all the surface ideas and again puts you into unfamiliar territory so you can start exploring more interesting solutions.
					</p>
					<p>
						How many ways can you lay out a blog or a registration screen? Given enough time, you can work through all the standard yawn-tastic UX patterns and move past them into a more creative solution, that may come at sketch number 15, number 27, or even number 32. Keep going until you find the right solution.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						Changing your scale, environment, or degree of output removes you from comfortable situations and comfortable solutions.
					</p>


					<h3 style="margin:1em auto .5em auto">Type and Color</h3>
					<h4>Change Your Tools</h4>
					<p>
						Having a problem with repetitive typography?
					</p>
					<p>
						Give <a href="http://www.typecast.com">TypeCast</a> a spin, to explore different combinations and with a vast library of typefaces. Pick up some design magazines or books and take a look at some of the ways they handle their typography lockups. Any new perspective will contribute to a different end result, helping you get out of a rut.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having a problem with color palettes?
					</p>
					<p>
						Using Dribbble is a great way to explore color palettes. Not only can you search by specific colors, but you can download the palettes in .aco file formats! (they drop right into Photoshop’s swatches). There are also some great exploratory color tools such as <a href="http://www.paletton.com">Paletton</a>, <a href="http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/">iWantHue</a>, <a href="http://color.hailpixel.com/">HailPixel</a> among many, many others.
					</p>

					<h2>Other Ways To Do It</h2>
					<p>
						I encourage you to try some of these things:
					</p>

					<ul class="post-li">
						<li>Sketch with your opposite-of-dominant hand.</li>
						<li>Sketch in pencil vs. ballpoint pen vs. sharpie vs. calligraphic pen.</li>
						<li>Go Big, Go Small, Go Analog, Go Digital.</li>
						<li>Try gridded paper, try blank paper. Brown paper, Pink paper, Green paper...</li>
						<li>Don’t immediately draw a container to put your thoughts into, let them grow organically, then chop them up into usable chunks afterwards.</li>
						<li>Try to find double or triple solutions for a problem. Overkill? Maybe, but you will unearth interesting things.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						At this point you may be thinking, “This is ridiculous! Did he really just say that sketching with my non-dominant hand will magically solve all of my problems?”
					</p>
					<p>
						Yeah, kinda.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout all this, the goal is to create. You are exploring ideas. You are trying to find something that sparks an idea, or a new way to solve a common problem through a new perspective.
					</p>
					<p>
						What you DON’T want is to be staring at a blank page, with the pressure to put down the perfect solution on the second, third, or fourth try. When that happens, you start to use shortcuts and commonly used UX patterns that make your sites look similar. That’s the definition of a rut. That is what we are trying to avoid!
					</p>
					<p>
						Do you have a technique you use, that isn’t listed here? Let me know on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/leevw">Twitter</a>!
