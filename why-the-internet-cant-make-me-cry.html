				<h4 class="center bottom-margin-double">A brief rant on the emotionally stunted internet.</h5>
				<div class="text-container bottom-margin-double">
					<p> 
						I have done a lot of thinking lately, about the internet as a whole.
					</p>
					<p> 
						I 100% believe that the internet will follow in the footsteps of past media (as any new media does), but eventually expand into uncharted territory, and in some respects, it already has done that. I also believe that the internet is stunted in the kinds of interactions we have with it.
					</p>
					<p> 
						I find myself trying to draw comparisons to motion pictures. Movies get to be sorted into these very neat categories, which usually helps viewers to set expectations about the film they’re about to watch. These categories also help to emotionally prime the audience for what they’re about to experience. These are called genres.
					</p>
					<p> 
						Today we will talk about the entertainment genres (entertainment being a function), though the thought experiment can be applied to non-entertainment genres as well.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="text-container bottom-margin-double">
					<h2> Evolution of Movie Genres</h2>
					<p>
						Movies draw heavily on the medium that came before it, literature, in how they are categorized. Taking a look at only some of the major entertainment movie genres, we have:
					</p>
					<ul class="post-li">
						<li>Action</li>
						<li>Drama</li>
						<li>Fantasy</li>
						<li>Sci-Fi</li>
						<li>Comedy</li>
						<li>Horror, etc...</li>
					</ul>


					<p>
						I’d like to talk a little bit about these, but first let’s think back to some of the earliest motion pictures. They had no soundtrack, no color, no plot and usually consisted of a single shot. How did we arrive to these major genres from something that is considered by today’s standards to be… well, not a movie at all.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of the first classic examples of motion pictures are Edward Muybridge’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEqccPhsqgA&noredirect=1">documentation of the horse running</a>, to see if it leaves the ground at full gallop (spoiler: it does), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1i40rnpOsA">The Roundhay Garden Scene </a> lasting a mere 2 seconds. Then somewhere along the way, someone made a 30 second movie, then a 60 second movie, then a 30 minute movie, and eventually we got to the current 2-3 hour snoozefest movies.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						I’m looking at you Captain Phillips..
					</p class="bottom-margin-double">
					<img class="image-container" src="images/sleepy-dog.gif" />
				</div>
				
				<div class="text-container bottom-margin-double">
					<p>
						Along the way, people started to infuse emotion into these films and weave stories. Horror movies play on fear and surprise. Romantic Comedies play on the basic human functions of love and laughter. Adventure movies tell stories with constantly fluctuating emotions; the depths of despair and sadness followed by the triumphant overcoming of an obstacle leading to happiness. The first guy to intentionally put violence into a film as entertainment, what a horrible person, right? I can’t fault him though. Not only did many literary works before him use violence as entertainment, the fact is, that it’s wildly successful and it connects with people at an emotional level, whether it be for better or for worse.
					</p>
					<p>
						The crazy part to me is, this explosion of emotion described above, is passively conveyed to us through our eyes alone. The only interaction we have, is shoving a handful of popcorn into our mouths as we watch.
					</p>
					</div>


				<div class="text-container text-container-post">
					<h2>Enter the Internet.</h2>
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						Let’s take a look at the internet with this thought fresh in our minds.
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						When was the last time you went to a website, and it made you experience the same feelings as when a loving bond between father and son was severed by a pack of stampeding wildebeests?
					</p>
					<img class="bottom-margin-double" src="images/lionking.png" />
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						When was the last time you went to a website, and it made you feel as emotionally invested in the successes and failures of someone with all odds against them?
					</p>
					<img class="bottom-margin-double" src="images/frodoring.png" />
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						When was the last time you went to a website, and it made you question reality as a whole?
					</p>
					<img class="bottom-margin-double" src="images/matrix.png" />
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						So what is a good example of raw emotion on the internet? This. This, is genius, and it is nowhere near the complexity and range of emotions that a true horror film has. This experience will NEVER be forgotten by this young man. There is a good chance that this site had an impact on his life, long beyond the few minutes he interacted with it. It's unfortunate it had to be traumatizing horror, but it illustrates the point so clearly.
					</p>
					<img class="image-container" src="images/scared-maze.gif" />
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						More often than not, the last time you used the internet, you bought something and had it delivered to your door. Or you communicated with someone halfway across the world, whether it be by chat or email. Or you used a tool to help accomplish something in your workplace. Or you read Wikipedia and learned something new. Or you read some guy’s thoughts about the internet on a blog (see what I did here..) They make you kinda feel like this:
					</p>
					<img class="image-container" src="images/dog-maze.gif" />
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						And yeah, these things are really great functions of the internet, but none of them made you feel the way movies do or the way a really good book does. Rarely do any of them make you aspire to be something greater. Almost never do you see kids that want to grow up to be a LOLcat (I think this is a good thing…) Movies have kids and adults alike, wanting to be princesses, astronauts, firefighters, military, robots, and tons of other things. They have an actual impact on people’s lives and aspirations. Personally, I aspire to be a combination of Leonidas and Neo, with a little bit of Wall-e thrown in. So far, I am achieving this combination.
					</p>
					<p>
						Where is the rich exploration of emotion? The aspirations, the happiness, the love, the sadness? When was the last time you needed to bring tissues with you to interact with the internet? … Don’t answer that. What was the last website that had a dramatic impact on how you conduct your life?
					</p>
					<p>
						For Pete’s sake, we have double the interaction that we do with moving pictures, but we have explored only a fraction of what we can do with it.
					</p>
					<p>
						So I put out this challenge to you. Make something outside of how the internet expects you to use it. Don’t just set up another Squarespace shop. Don’t just create another messaging app. Don’t make another blog with ads plastered all over it. Don’t slap a video on your site to do the 'emotional heavy-lifting'. Quit trying to sell me something and create things that inspire people to be better human beings. Connect with people on the internet in a meaningful, real, and emotional way in your next project.
					</p>
					<p>
						Go out and make something real… at least by internet standards.
