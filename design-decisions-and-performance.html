					<p> 
						Being a completely honest designer, Web Performance is not the first thing that I consider when I set out to design the look and feel for a new client. Still being completely honest, I curse myself when I run into performance problems that are caused by design or UX decisions that I unknowingly made in the early stages of a project.
					</p>
					<p> 
						I'll be referencing the HTTP Archive stats for 2013 to talk about the heaviest assets being downloaded from a webpage.
					</p>
					<p> 
						According to these stats, images are a huge portion of your site's weight, followed by scripts.
					</p>
					<p> 
						The good news is, as designers and UX'ers, you are in control of these things from the beginning. 
					</p>
					<p> 						
						Some things to keep your eye on are:
					</p>
					<ul class="post-li">
						<li>Pixel Dimensions of Images</li>
						<li>Type of Images (.gif vs .jpg vs .png)</li>
						<li>Background textures and patterns</li>
						<li>inclusion of videos</li>
						<li>Number of image assets on the page</li>
						<li>Image Implementation </li>
						<li>Calls to external files (APIs, JS Libraries, Fonts)</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						As a good designer (you are a great designer), we must assume that the site you are creating will be seen by <i>someone</i> a 3G network or 56k modem. What does this mean? It means, keep it simple and light.
					</p>
					<h2>Pixel Dimensions</h2>
					<p>
						This first point is obvious. A full screen background image, will weigh more than a slider image, which will weigh more than a thumbnail image, which will weigh more than just text. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Which of these is the most appropriate for the situation? Is the image even needed, or were you getting carried away again? If it's a background image, can it be dropped on mobile? Or must it exist as a vital piece of information (ex: a product image on an ecommerce site.) Can we make bets that a majority of tablet and desktop users will be near some form of high-speed Internet? Should we still cater to people with 56k?
					</p>
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						As a great designer, I'm happy to hear you say that the site should try to be accessible to everyone. Yes, even people who still use dial-up.
					</p>
					<h2>.JPG vs .PNG Formats</h2>
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						The type of image is important as well. All compressions are not equal. Generally a .jpg will give you smaller file sizes than a .png when you are dealing with larger images. What does this mean? It means, do not lock yourself into a design that needs a transparent background on essential images. Choosing to display these heavier images on slower speed networks is inviting handcuffs to the performance party.
					</p>
					<h2>Textures &amp; Patterns</h2>
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						Background textures are great, and fun, and they bring the site to life in some instances. In a lot of instances, they are complete overkill. The best use of a texture is to find a repeatable pattern so you can load smaller sized images and repeat over a large area. Know when to cut out the textures in favor of speed. If you have more than 3 or 4 textures, you are way over the texture budget.
					</p>
					<h2>Number of Requests</h2>
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						The number of images or requests on the page makes a big difference on performance. When you are drawing up the wireframes, the decision to load 20 or 30 thumbnail images versus 10 with a load more button can affect the performance of the site. Loading dynamic content (ex: suggested products based on shopping habits, twitter feeds, related products) will slow down page load times as opposed to having standard content that is the same for everyone who visits the page (ex: previous product, next product). When you incorporate dynamic content, make sure it is worth it to add the extra download weight.
					</p>
					<h2>Image Implementation</h2>
					<p class="bottom-margin-double">
						The topic of image implementation is creeping a little bit into the area of scripts. Understand that a slider or lightbox naturally weighs more than a static image because of the amount of components we have to load to make it function. Incorporating something like a 'parallax effect' can alienate a large number of users because they simply dont have the hardware to render it smoothly or the bandwidth to download it within an acceptable timeframe. You have multiple images to load, and if you grabbed some plugin, you more than likely have a bunch of bloat in the code.
					</p>

					<h2>Find Your Own Way</h2>
					<p>
						All this being said, if we were going for optimal performance, every website would look like Craigslist. The real trick is to balance a sensible design that fits the brand of the client, with performance in mind, knowing that you will be making some sacrifices for the visual aesthetic.
					</p>
					<p>
						Making a website that is accessible and usable to all people, on any device, is generally a good move. Even keeping all of this in mind, you may run into problems with decisions you made early in the process, and sometimes that cannot be helped. There is no substitute for experience, and hopefully next time, you will be aware of the consequences of the decisions you are making.
